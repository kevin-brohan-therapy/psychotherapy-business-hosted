        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h4>How long does therapy typically last?</h4>
<p>The length of therapy varies greatly depending on individual needs and goals. Some people find benefit from just a few sessions, while others may engage in longer-term work lasting several months or years. During the assessment period (usually 4-6 sessions), we'll explore what might work best for you.</p>
<h4>How often do sessions take place?</h4>
<p>Most clients find weekly sessions helpful, especially in the beginning. As therapy progresses, some people prefer fortnightly sessions. We'll discuss what frequency feels right for you during our initial conversations.</p>
<h4>What happens in the first session?</h4>
<p>The first session is part of the assessment period where we get to know each other and explore what's brought you to therapy. We'll discuss your hopes and concerns, and begin to understand your situation together. There's no pressure to share anything you're not comfortable with.</p>
<h4>Do you offer online sessions?</h4>
<p>Yes, we offer both face-to-face and online sessions via secure video calling. Many clients find online sessions just as effective as in-person meetings. We can discuss what works best for your circumstances.</p>
<h4>What if I'm not sure therapy is right for me?</h4>
<p>It's completely normal to feel uncertain about starting therapy. The introductory call is designed to help you get a sense of whether working together feels right, with no pressure or commitment. Many people find this conversation helpful in itself.</p>
<h4>Is everything I say confidential?</h4>
<p>Yes, everything discussed in therapy is confidential. There are very rare exceptions related to safety or legal requirements, which would be discussed with you if they ever arose. Your privacy and trust are fundamental to the therapeutic process.</p>
<h4>How much do sessions cost?</h4>
<p>Session fees vary depending on the therapist and your individual circumstances. We believe therapy should be accessible, so please don't hesitate to discuss fees during your initial contact. Some reduced-rate spaces may be available.</p>
<h4>What if I need to cancel or change an appointment?</h4>
<p>Life happens, and we understand that sometimes you need to change appointments. We ask for as much notice as possible, and will discuss our cancellation policy during the initial arrangements.</p>
<h4>Can I contact you between sessions?</h4>
<p>While therapy primarily takes place during scheduled sessions, you can always reach out via email if something urgent arises. We'll respond as soon as possible and discuss whether an additional session might be helpful.</p>
<h4>What therapeutic approaches do you use?</h4>
<p>Our therapists draw from various approaches including psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, and integrative methods. The approach we use together will be tailored to your specific needs and what feels most helpful for your situation.</p>
